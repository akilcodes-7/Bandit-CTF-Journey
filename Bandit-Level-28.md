```


---

### 🧠 Explanation

### 🔐 Concept Learned  

This level demonstrates how deleted data can still exist in Git history.  
It shows why sensitive data should never be committed to version control.


---

### 🛡️ Security Insight  

Secrets must be removed using history rewriting tools.  
Simply deleting them from the latest commit is not sufficient.
