By triggering the `more` pager and escaping into Vim, a real Bash shell can be spawned.

Steps followed:  
- Copy the SSH private key  
- Log in as `bandit26`  
- Force `more` into interactive mode  
- Escape to Vim  
- Launch a Bash shell  
- Read the password file

### 🧪 Commands Used  

- `ls`  
- `file bandit26.sshkey`  
- `scp -P 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit25/bandit26.sshkey .`  
- `chmod 600 bandit26.sshkey`  
- `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`  
- `v`

### 🔐 Concept Learned  

This level demonstrates how restricted shells can be bypassed.  
It shows how pagers and editors can be abused to gain full command-line access.


---

### 🛡️ Security Insight  

Restricted environments must prevent editor escapes.  
Otherwise, attackers can bypass sandboxed shells and gain full control.
